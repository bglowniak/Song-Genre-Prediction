# Song Genre Prediction

This project utilizes unsupervised and supervised learning methods to analyze and predict the genre of a song based on its inherent features. The project code can be found in [Project Notebook.ipynb](Project%20Notebook.ipynb) and the project results can be explored [here](https://bglowniak.github.io/SongGenrePrediction/) (hosted using Github Pages).

The data set was found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db) and is pulled from Spotify's API. It includes various quantitative features like acousticness, danceability, energy, and instrumentalness. Data cleaning and processing methods are explained in the first part of the notebook.

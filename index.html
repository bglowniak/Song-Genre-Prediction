<p>For our project, we wanted to take data from a set of songs, and then use those songs' features to predict their genre. With the rise of digital streaming in the past decade, accessibility to music has increased drastically and in return so has the demand for people to explore music similar to what they already like. An accurate genre predictor for songs is crucial for music distributing sites such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. Thus, we aim to create an algorithm using K Means and Linear/Logistic Regression to predict which song a genre belongs to.</p>

<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h3>
<p>Our dataset is a collection of 232,725 songs pulled from Spotify's API with a total of 26 different genres and 18 features. We downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. Also, we ended up removing tracks from 11 different genres as we deemed many of the songs in those genres to have been erroneously classified and were detrimental to the overall dataset. Thus, we ended up with 132,097 tracks assigned to 15 genres. The genres included were Country, Dance, Alternative, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop, Indie, R&B, Classical, Rap, Raggae, Pop, Rock, and Soul. Out of the 17 other features, we only chose to use 8 as we found the others to either be poor predictors for any genre or inconsequential data like a track's id or URI:
  <ul>
<!--     <li>Key: The key of the track using Pitch Class Notation (0=C, 1=C#, etc)</li>
    <li>Mode: Mode of the track (0=Minor, 1=Major)</li>
    <li>Time_Signature: How many beats in each measure</li> -->
    <li>Acousticness: Confidence from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic</li>
    <li>Danceability: How suitable a track is for dancing from 0.0 to 1.0</li>
    <li>Energy: How energetic a track is from 0.0 to 1.0</li>
    <li>Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals from 0.0 to 1.0</li>
    <li>Liveness: Detects likelihood of an audience in recording from 0.0 to 1.0</li>
    <!-- <li>Loudness: Average loudness of a track in decibels (dB)</li> -->
    <li>Speechiness: Detects presence of spoken words w/o instrumentals from 0.0 to 1.0</li>
    <li>Valence: Measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of the positivity conveyed by a track</li>
    <li>Tempo: Overall estimated tempo in beats per minutes (BPM)</li>
  </ul>

<p>To start, we decided to use K Means as a way to determine which features were stronger predictors than others. This was originally how we were able to eliminate certain features like Loudness and Time Signature from the dataset. Then, we used the Elbow Rule to find the opitmal number of clusters in K Means, which was 9.

  What would it mean?
  How do you compare your method to other methods?

  The potential next steps we would take in furthering this project and obtaining better results would be to be more selctive 
  with what features we are analyzing. Since our current feature analysis was not a consistently good genre predictor, re-evaluating
  which features are better predictors would be beneficial. This re-evaluation may mean cutting out some features but possibly also 
  considering others that were not originally included in the analysis. In addition to being more selective with features, 
  giving each feature a weight would also help our models better predict genre. This would allow us to still consider multiple 
  features but would put more emphasis on the features that more directly correlate with genre prediction.  

  out data incosistent w the weird genres
